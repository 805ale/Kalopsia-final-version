INTRODUCTION
------------
This is the installation file for Kalopsia

REQUIEREMENTS
-----------------
In order to run Kalopsia, you need to have Unity3D version 2020.3.3f1 installed in your PC.
https://store.unity.com/
To download Unity, you need to choose the individual plan, either student or personal and sign up with an account.

INSTALLATION
-----------------
Unity will instal first Unity Hub, which can be useful to add and manage different projects.
Download the project files attached in the OneDrive folder 'Kalopsia final'.
After installation of the Unity program, to install Kalopsia, in the 'Projects' section which can be found in the left side of Unity Hub, click on 'Add' and select the 'Kalopsia final' folder. Select the 2020.3.3f1 version press on the selected path. 

PROJECT OVERVIEW
-----------------
The main aim of this project was to create a 3D game environment capable of generating customizable and explorable worlds using procedural content generation. 
Procedural content generation can be defined as the algorithmic generation of content. This technique brings many advantages to the design and implementation processes of game development, reducing development time and memory storage requirements. By automating systems that would normally consume a large period of development time, it allows to instead work on less automatable systems such as AI, physics and graphics. Terrain generation, items, quests and NPC placement are highly suitable for procedural content generation. 


PLANET CUSTOMIZER
-----------------
The first step was to create some procedurally generated planets. These planets are intended to be viewed from afar, as a level of detail system has not been implemented in this part. In the process of creating the planet customizer, some important features are: 
The customizer editor: holds planetâ€™s shape and colour settings
Layered noise: using multiple layers of noise to add detail
Multiple noise filters: adds variety and even more detailed features
Shader: gradient-based shader that can be customized depending on the height of the terrain at each point
Biomes: dividing the planet into different regions based on latitude

PROCEDURAL TERRAIN GENERATION
------------------------------
The other part of this project included designing a procedural generator capable of creating endless terrain that can be also customized before entering the gameworld. Some techniques used are mentioned here:
Noise map, colour map using Perlin noise that can be turned into textures.
LOD: multiple mesh resolutions
Fall off map: ensures that a landmass is entirely surrounded by water
Colour shader, texture shader
